# Blockchain Integration Plan for CivicConnect

## 1. Setup Blockchain Environment
- [ ] Install required dependencies (ethers.js, @thirdweb-dev/sdk)
- [ ] Set up a free blockchain network (Polygon Mumbai Testnet)
- [ ] Get test MATIC tokens from a faucet

## 2. Smart Contract Development
- [ ] Create a Solidity smart contract (HashStorage.sol)
- [ ] Implement functions to store and retrieve issue hashes
- [ ] Add event emissions for issue creation and updates

## 3. Backend Integration
- [ ] Create a blockchain service to interact with the smart contract
- [ ] Implement functions to connect to wallet and sign transactions
- [ ] Add error handling and transaction status tracking

## 4. Frontend Updates
- [ ] Add wallet connection button
- [ ] Update issue submission flow to store hash on blockchain
- [ ] Display blockchain transaction status

## 5. Firebase Integration
- [ ] Store raw issue data in Firestore
- [ ] Store blockchain transaction hashes with issue documents
- [ ] Add real-time updates for issue verification status

## 6. Testing
- [ ] Test smart contract functionality
- [ ] Test end-to-end issue submission flow
- [ ] Verify data integrity between blockchain and Firebase

## 7. Deployment
- [ ] Deploy smart contract to Polygon Mumbai Testnet
- [ ] Update environment variables for production
- [ ] Test in production environment

## Required Dependencies
- ethers.js
- @thirdweb-dev/sdk
- @thirdweb-dev/react (for easy wallet connection)
- dotenv (for environment variables)
