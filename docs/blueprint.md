## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(195, 70%, 50%) which converts to RGB Hex: #34A0A4. A vibrant, modern teal-adjacent blue-green to reflect trustworthiness and technological innovation, avoiding a literal 'civic' color.
- Background color: HSL(195, 20%, 95%) which converts to RGB Hex: #F0F8FA. Very light tint of the primary to give depth without overwhelming.
- Accent color: HSL(165, 50%, 40%) which converts to RGB Hex: #5CB87A. A desaturated but well contrasted green provides highlights to key actions and focus points.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use a set of consistent, minimalist icons. Consider using a consistent line weight and style across all icons.
- Implement a mobile-first, fully responsive design with rounded corners and glassmorphism accents for a modern, sleek look.
- Ensure smooth transitions and animations, especially for light/dark mode toggle, hero text reveal, card stagger animations, and hover/tap interactions. Consider subtle animations to add a polished feel.
